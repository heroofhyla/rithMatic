~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
rithMatic is a program that generates arithmetic worksheets. The 
worksheets can cover addition, subtraction, multiplication, and 
division. The types of problems presented depend on the command line 
arguments, as detailed below.

-a	ADDITION
rithMatic generates all possible problems involving the addition of 2
single-digit numbers.

-s	SUBTRACTION
rithMatic generates all possible problems involving the subtraction of
2 single-digit numbers. Negative results are possible.

-m	MULTIPLICATION
rithMatic generates all possible problems involving the multiplication
of 2 single-digit numbers.

-d	DIVISION
rithMatic generates all possible problems involving the division of 2
single-digit numbers, except for those which involve division by 0.
Unlike other problem sets, the division problems are constructed as 
(i*k)/k. This ensures that the results will be whole numbers.

-u UNIQUE
Problems which are the reverse of existing problems in the set are
skipped. The problem with the lower number first is kept (2+4 will be
kept, not 4+2). This means that all subtraction problems have negative
results. A future flag may change this. Because of their format,
division problems are naturally unique. This flag will make no
difference on a set of only division problems.

-r RANDOMIZE
Problems are output in a random order.

-l	LaTeX MODE
The output is formatted for future rendering using LaTeX. All problems
are organized as tabulars. In the future, there may be a flag to
determine how division problems are formatted, as I am not currently
very happy with their appearance. If this flag is not set, the output
is in plain text, and looks like "4-7=__ ".

-h	HEADER
The output starts with lines where a name and a date may be entered.

-c <x>	COLUMNS
The output is organized into <x> columns. <x> defaults to 10 if -c is
not set.

-o <x> FILE OUTPUT
Output is saved to a file named <x>. If this flag is not set, the
output is sent to the terminal.

Sample usage:

./rithMatic -a -s -r -h -l -c 6 -o addsubset1.tex
Generates all possible addition and subtraction problems using single-
digit numbers, and formats them for rendering in LaTeX. The problems 
are arranged randomly.  Problems are organized into 6 columns. Fields
for name and date are added to the top of the page. The output is 
saved to "addsubset1.tex" and can later be rendered using a program 
like pdflatex.

./rithMatic
The default usage. Generates every single digit math problem, and
outputs them in order to the command prompt in plain text. The output
is organized into 10 columns.
